## 🔍 **1. Discovery is Instant**

**Goal**: Enable users to find data assets using natural language

### 🔹 Tasks:

* **Metadata Ingestion**

  * Extract metadata from data sources (DBs, warehouses, APIs, etc.)
  * Normalize across sources (schema, table, column, lineage)

* **Semantic Annotation**

  * Add business terms, synonyms, tags, domains to technical metadata
  * Map assets to glossary entries or entities (e.g., “Customer”, “Loan”)

* **Embedding Generation**

  * Convert names, descriptions, tags into vector embeddings (OpenAI, BERT, etc.)

* **Vector Indexing & Search**

  * Store embeddings in vector DB (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone)
  * Implement similarity-based search using LLMs or search APIs

* **Search Interface**

  * Build CLI with smart autocomplete, filters, and search ranking
  * Optionally enrich search with knowledge graph traversal (e.g., show related assets)

## 📝 **2. Documentation is Automatic**

**Goal**: Auto-generate and maintain rich, business-friendly data documentation

### 🔹 Tasks:

* **Schema Profiling**

  * Analyze structure, types, value distributions, and example data

* **AI-Based Documentation**

  * Use LLMs to summarize datasets, columns, and joins in plain language
  * Auto-fill field descriptions using glossary matches and AI hints

* **Glossary Linking**

  * Connect assets to glossary terms (manual or AI-assisted mapping)

* **Change Detection & Versioning**

  * Track schema changes and automatically update affected documentation

* **Collaboration Layer**

  * Enable user feedback, ratings, edits, and tagging directly in UI

## 💬 **3. Analytics are Conversational**

**Goal**: Allow users to query data using plain English and receive answers or charts

### 🔹 Tasks:

* **NLQ Pipeline**

  * Translate natural language into SQL using schema-aware prompting
  * Validate and optimize queries for performance and safety

* **LLM Context Injection**

  * Use semantic model + data catalog to provide context to LLMs
  * Support join inference, metric resolution, and disambiguation

* **Query Execution & Visualization**

  * Execute validated queries and return tabular or visual results
  * Auto-select chart types and generate summaries

* **Conversational Flow Management**

  * Enable follow-ups, drill-downs, and clarifying questions
  * Optionally persist memory context per session

## 🛡️ **4. Governance is Seamless**

**Goal**: Automate data quality checks, access controls, and compliance policies

### 🔹 Tasks:

* **Data Classification**

  * Tag PII, PHI, financial fields using rules and ML models
  * Assign compliance levels (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, etc.)

* **Policy Enforcement Engine**

  * Define and enforce access controls, data usage rules, retention policies
  * Apply restrictions during search and query execution

* **Quality Monitoring**

  * Auto-generate quality rules (null checks, type drift, outliers)
  * Alert on failures and log lineage impact

* **Audit Trail and Lineage**

  * Track data usage, transformations, and access events
  * Visualize lineage from source to dashboard/report

* **Governance Dashboards**

  * Display data health, ownership, access logs, and remediation status

---

## ♾️ Optional: **Knowledge Graph Layer (Cross-Cutting)**

**Goal**: Enable deep relationship mapping and reasoning over assets

### 🔹 Tasks:

* **Entity Modeling**

  * Define entities (Customer, Product, Loan) and link to datasets/columns

* **Relationship Extraction**

  * Map joins, feature usage, report dependencies, business processes

* **Graph Construction**

  * Build graph database (Neo4j, Neptune) from semantic model
  * Support traversal, impact analysis, root cause analysis

* **LLM Integration with KG**

  * Use KG as context provider for LLMs or agents
  * Enable structured query generation (Cypher/SPARQL)
